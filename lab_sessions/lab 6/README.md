## 1. Executive Summary

This lab implements a transaction concurrency control engine written in C++17. It integrates three major database execution architectures:
1. **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)**: Keeps old versions of records visible to older snapshots while appending new versions, ensuring readers do not block writers and writers do not block readers.
2. **Strict Two-Phase Locking (Strict 2PL)**: Locks are grown continuously during execution and only released altogether during the commit or abort phases, guaranteeing serializability and avoiding cascading aborts.
3. **Deadlock Detection**: Models transaction dependencies in a Waits-For graph and detects cycles via Depth-First Search (DFS) to resolve deadlocks.

| Component | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- |
| `transaction_manager.cpp` | Core implementation containing the `RecordVersion`, `LockRegistry`, `DeadlockGraph`, and `TxnCoordinator` classes. |

## 3. Build & Run Instructions

To compile and run the engine, use the following commands:

```bash
# Build the binary using CMake
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make

# Run the executable
./txn_manager
```

```

### 1. Record Versioning & MVCC Storage
Instead of overwriting rows in-place, the database stores a chain of versions for each key:
```cpp
struct RecordVersion {
    TransactionID creator_tx;    // ID of the transaction that inserted this version
    TransactionID deleter_tx;    // ID of the transaction that deleted/superseded this version (0 if active)
    std::string data_payload;    // The actual values stored in the database
};

struct VersionHistory {
    std::vector<RecordVersion> list; // Ordered list of historical versions
};
```

* **Visibility Rules**: A version is visible to a transaction with snapshot ID $S$ if:
  $$\text{creator\_tx} \le S \quad \text{AND} \quad (\text{deleter\_tx} = 0 \lor \text{deleter\_tx} > S)$$

### 2. Lock Registry (Strict 2PL)
Locks are divided into `SHARED` (read) and `EXCLUSIVE` (write) modes:
* Multiple transactions can concurrently hold `SHARED` locks on a row.
* A row can only have one `EXCLUSIVE` lock holder at a time.
* All locks are retained until the transaction fully commits or rolls back (`Strict 2PL` constraint).

### 3. Deadlock Graph
Monitors transaction blockages. An edge from $T_A \to T_B$ indicates transaction $T_A$ is blocked waiting for a lock held by $T_B$. A background check (or checked on blockage) uses DFS to identify cycles:
* If a cycle is detected, one of the transactions (e.g., the victim) is aborted to resolve the circular dependency.

## 5. Console Output & Test Cases

The driver runs three core tests to showcase the invariants:

--- Scenario 1: Basic MVCC Visibility ---

[ENGINE] BEGIN Txn 1 (Snapshot = 1)
[REGISTRY] Txn 1 acquired EXCLUSIVE lock on user:101
[STORE] Txn 1 updates user:101 = 'name=Ayush'
[REGISTRY] Txn 1 released EXCLUSIVE lock on user:101
[COMMIT] Txn 1 committed successfully

[ENGINE] BEGIN Txn 2 (Snapshot = 2)

[ENGINE] BEGIN Txn 3 (Snapshot = 3)

[REGISTRY] Txn 3 acquired EXCLUSIVE lock on user:101
[STORE] Txn 3 updates user:101 = 'name=Patra'

## 6. Key Learnings & Engineering Trade-offs

1. **MVCC Overhead vs. Performance**: Storing version chains eliminates read-write bottlenecks but increases storage costs. Database engines must employ garbage collectors (such as `VACUUM` in PostgreSQL) to clean up dead versions.
2. **Strict 2PL Correctness**: Strict locking protocols prevent anomalies like dirty reads or write skew, though they increase lock contention and latency on hot rows.
3. **Deadlock Recovery**: DFS-based deadlock detection avoids permanent system lockups, but aborting transactions incurs rollback and retry overheads.
